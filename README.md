## General information
----------------------
For now, it only includes a Matlab code written by Marine Poizat in 2019
to plot data for salt solutions (density, acticity, index of refraction etc.)
and a preliminary python code written by Leo Martin in 2020 to calculate
the saturation vapor pressure Psat(T) of pure water.

## Module requirements
----------------------
None for now.

## Python requirements
----------------------
Python : >= 3.6 (because of f-strings)
